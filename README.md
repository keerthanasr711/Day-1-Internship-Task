**🧹Data Cleaning & Preprocessing – Project Summary**

**📌 Project Objective:**
The primary objective of this project was to prepare a raw dataset—containing information on orders, shipments, and transactions—for further analysis. This process involved managing missing data, standardizing column names, adjusting data types, and exporting a clean, structured version of the dataset in CSV format.

**🔧 Key Steps Taken:**

1  Dataset Loading
Imported the raw data into a Pandas DataFrame using Jupyter Notebook for efficient processing and exploration.

2  Handling Missing Values
Detected null (NaN) values across several columns.
Replaced missing values in shipping-related fields (ship_city, ship_state, ship_postal_code, ship_country, fulfilled_by) with 0 to maintain structural integrity.
Eliminated rows with missing entries in essential financial fields (currency and amount) to preserve data quality.

3  Column Name Standardization
Renamed all columns to follow a consistent snake_case format—lowercase letters with underscores—enhancing readability and ensuring compatibility with coding standards.

4  Data Type Adjustments
Converted the ship_postal_code column to integer for numeric operations.
Transformed the date column into Pandas datetime format for improved time-based analysis.
 ⚠️ Notable Challenge
 📅 Date Conversion Warning

A warning was encountered during the conversion of the date column:
"UserWarning: Could not infer format, so each element will be parsed individually..."
Resolution: It's best practice to define the date format explicitly using the format argument in pd.to_datetime() to ensure accurate and consistent parsing while improving performance.

**✅ Final Result**
The dataset is now thoroughly cleaned and fully standardized.
All missing values have been addressed, appropriate data types applied, and column names formatted consistently.
The dataset is now ready for use in downstream tasks such as reporting, data visualization, or machine learning workflows.
